# Public School Chatbot
## Project Overview:

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the development of a chatbot aimed at facilitating the school registration process for immigrant children and their parents. This project is dedicated to providing hassle-free support and access to resources for this specific user group, ensuring a smoother transition into the educational system.

## Objective:

Our primary objective is to research and analyze the unique needs of immigrant children and their parents during the school registration process. By understanding their requirements, challenges, and expectations, we aim to design and develop a user-centered chatbot solution that streamlines the registration process and provides personalized assistance.

## Approach:

We will employ a multi-faceted approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods. This includes conducting interviews, surveys, and data analysis to gather insights into the needs and preferences of our target users. Additionally, we will thoroughly examine the requirements and procedures of the school registration process to ensure our chatbot meets all necessary criteria.

## Implementation:

Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and user-centered design principles, we will design and develop the chatbot to be intuitive, responsive, and supportive. The chatbot will be capable of understanding and processing user queries, providing relevant information, guiding users through the registration process, and offering assistance whenever needed.
